#
# Systemd Service file for `privex/looking-glass`
#
# Requires `gobgpd` to be installed into /usr/bin and config at /etc/gbgp.conf (edit if required)
#
# To use this file, copy it into /etc/systemd/system/gobgp.service and ensure you've placed your GoBGP config
# at /etc/gbgp.conf
#
# Once adjusted for your specific installation, run the following:
#
#    systemctl enable gobgp.service
#    systemctl start gobgp.service
#
# GoBGP Daemon will now have started in the background as a systemd service, and will automatically start on reboot
