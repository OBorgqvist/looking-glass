# Systemd Service file for `privex/looking-glass`
#
# To use this file, copy it into /etc/systemd/system/lg-queue.service , replace LGUSER with the username of the Linux
# account it was installed into, and adjust the paths if necessary.
#
# Once adjusted for your specific installation, run the following:
#
#    systemctl enable lg-queue.service
#    systemctl start lg-queue.service
#
# lg-queue will now have started in the background as a systemd service, and will automatically start on reboot
